                            <p>Isa El-Buba, commonly referred to as Prophet Isa El-Buba, is a Nigerian charismatic prophet
                                and philanthropist. He is the leader and founder of El-Buba Outreach Ministries
                                International (EBOMI). Prophet Isa El-Buba was a former Islamic occultist, who served the queen of
                                heaven from his childhood as a dedicated child. He inherited Islamic occultism from birth until 1982
                                when he experienced the exceeding grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that brought salvation to him,
                                baptized him with the Holy Spirit, commissioned him to preach the gospel, and gave him Godly heritage.
                                Before his salvation, the Lord gave him series of revelations of the reality of hell.

                                On the 1st of January, in the early sixties, baby Isa was born in the then Benue-Plateau General
                                Hospital, Jos (now referred to as the Jos University Teaching Hospital, (JUTH). According to Mama
                                Roseline, the delivery was very effortless as she and the new-born baby were discharge same day.
                                In the meantime, Baba Sadiq Buba (though a Muslim) prophetically named his born son: "ISA"-in Arabic
                                meaning "JESUS CHRIST". Barely two months later, the baby had severe running stomach and both mother
                                and child were back to the same hospital. The baby was placed on intravenous drip but during that time
                                the baby was often noticed kicking his legs in the air and raising his hands as if in praise. He was
                                healed miraculously. The doctor in-charge discharged mother and child but remarked that the baby was a
                                special child.

                                The family lived in block 1, house A1 in the present Jos prisons quarters directly besides the
                                high fenced prisons wall. Both the place of Birth (Jos, Nigeria) and year of Isa's birth were
                                divinely and prophetically scripted by God. Isa was to trigger a massive spiritual Renaissance
                                in Jos, Plateau that made many to refer to him as "The Prophet on the Plateau".

                                In 1982 he had an encounter with the Lord Jesus which led to his salvation after the Lord gave him a
                                revelation of hell. In 1983 he received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and answered the call of God
                                into the ministry.[1] After several revelations and encounter unknown to people around him, on the
                                23rd of March, 1982 marked a watershed in the life of Isa. Something happened. He came across, and
                                reluctantly watched a Christian film titled "Burning Hell". After the he was translated into heaven
                                and became the game-changer for his life. Isa melted in his heart, and in tears, surrendered to the
                                saving grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. He became born again. Isa then began the journey to fulfill
                                his divinely pre-destined purpose. He had never looked back since then. Apostle Isa El-buba, after
                                his dramatic conversion was taken to the desserts of Maiduguri and Buy while on the run for his life
                                from assassins, and trained directly by God. But as radical in his faith was in Islam so also did he
                                become radical in his new-found faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. His life was placed on his head by
                                several Islamic groups for assassination. So his natural abode became the desert and far jungle between
                                Maiduguri Jere. In that lonely state he had several divine visitation from the Lord that assured him
                                that he wasn't alone. Isa continually fasted and prayed while on the run for his life. This went on
                                for a few years. On a particular day in the early eighties, he sneaked into a church in the Biu
                                mountains area where he was hiding from assassinations. He has a strong desire to do anything possible
                                to support this church. So he decided to farm even though he had never farm before now. He saw a
                                man plowing a farmland and requested to plow the entire farmland for only N1500 (about$10) while on
                                a marathon dry fast. The next day, the 4th day of the fast, he completed the job in the midst of a
                                torrential rain at about 8pm having asked God for supernatural strength. He handed over the proceeds of that
                                hard labour to the procurement of the badly-needed items for worship. The Pastor prayed for him.

                                His ministry is accompanied with the manifestations of the presence and power of God, the Lord working
                                with him confirming His word with signs following. He has a special burden to reach the Muslim world
                                through publications so that they might understand the true God, and also to open the spiritual eyes
                                of Christians much more on the activities of cults and demons and how to deal with them.[2] Prophet
                                Isa El-Buba is the president of EL-Buba Outreach Ministries, Int., with headquarters in Jos, Plateau
                                state, Nigeria. He is married to Pastor Choice Isa El-Buba and God has blessed them with four children.
                                Isa's Influence and ministry in Nigeria saw him becoming the spiritual guard of several Governors,
                                Federal and state cabinet members, and has had the privilege of counseling and praying for several Nigerian
                                military and democratically-elected Heads of State and Presidents. This also has been the case with
                                several great Africa Heads of Government.

                                Just as Bablical Moses found a wife (Zipporah in Exodus chapter 2:21) when he was running from the
                                assassination threat from pharaoh, Isa likewise, while running for his life from Islamic assassins
                                found some protection in parts of Maiduguri and later Buy area, where he started to raise disciples
                                for Jesus. Among the early disciples of Isa was a very angelically beautiful lady called Mwapu Simon
                                Bami from Shaffa, Buy. She loved God, was committed to the teachings of Isa and was very faithful in
                                fellowship duties. Isa soon fell in love with Mwapuand on the 24th March, 1994 they got married. After
                                the wedding, he changed the name of his beloved wife to CHOICE El-BUBA. This is a woman he deeply loves
                                and the only onehe has known as a woman since he was born. That he also was the only man she had known
                                as man in her life. Through thick and thin, and in the midst of nine assassination attempts
                                on her husband, Choice, now a pastor, has stood by Isa as strong as a rock, encouraging
                                her husband to go on fighting the Lord's battles while she secures the home front. She
                                has also been a great mobilizer for the ministry. 'EBONITES love to call her ' Mummy"
                                because of her love and care. Her generosity has brought hope to many families.
                                The Almighty God has graciously blessed the marriage with four children namely: 1.
                                Princess Nissi Lami Hyelni Isa El-buba. 2. Deborah Queen Hyelsinta Isa El-buba. 3.
                                Precious Uriel Kaltume Hyelapandua Isa El-buba. 4. Jeremiah Mainasara Hyelakumi Isa El-buba.
